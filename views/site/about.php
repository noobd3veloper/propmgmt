                Is a company set up for Real-estate Companies, Property Management and Private Investors, which has had bad tenants that don’t like to pay their rent, and leaves you with hundreds and thousands of dollars in unpaid rent payments? 
                Most companies don’t send the tenants to the credit beaureas, because of the cost, and that alone eliminates if they own any back rent.
                A lot of the bad tenants will put their friends and families down for references, to be called to give them good references. You call and everything checks out ok.
                Three months down the road they stop paying their rent, You start the eviction process and it take up to two to three month or maybe more if they know the system.
                And that in itself will cost time and money.
